          When I was in high school, I won a gold medal in the National Biology Olympiad and received direct admission to Tsinghua University. Now I am a senior undergraduate student at the School of Life Sciences. During my undergraduate studies, my research focus has been on Neurobiology and Synthetic Biology. 

In my first year, I was selected for the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) team, which usually picks second-year students. With <a href="https://life.tsinghua.edu.cn/lifeen/info/1034/1088.htm" target="_blank">Prof. Guoqiang Chen</a>'s guidance, I spent a year researching Synthetic Biology. From my second year, I joined <a href="https://life.tsinghua.edu.cn/lifeen/info/1035/1105.htm" target="_blank">Prof. Yi Zhong</a>'s lab, studying the mechanisms of learning and memory.

During the summer of my third year, I worked at the Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) under the mentorship of <a href="https://www.sickkids.ca/en/staff/j/sheena-josselyn/" target="_blank">Prof. Sheena Josselyn</a>, who is one of the early pioneers of the engram theory. This experience helped me dive deeper into learning and memory research and introduced me to new techniques.

<br>Outside of academics, music holds a place in my heart. I've been learning opera singing (bel canto) since my freshman year and have joined marching band, choir as well as musical club, and have won <i>Expressive Musical Genius & Gold Prize (Age 18-21)</i> in Global Genius Music Competition

and <i>Dazzling Virtuoso Special Award & Gold Prize (Romantic B)</i> in Royale Music Competition. I genuinely believe that science and art enrich one another, highlighting the diverse ways humans can be creative.

In short, I am someone with a profound appreciation for both the intricacies of the brain and the magic of music, striving to become a scientist with refined tastes and aspirations.

            I applied Python DABEST package for data analysis on the duration of time mice spent in different zones of an open arena, refining the analytical process and optimizing output results. And I developed a new data visualization method based on Matlab polarscatter function, adding time information to existing
orientation angles of mice using color and radius. Generated figures for potential publication. To gain a deeper understanding of the experimental paradigms, I also engaged in Morris water maze experiments on mice to explore the impacts of social isolation on spatial memory.<br>

            I independently formulated the research question, designed and executed a comprehensive research plan, selected context and
sound as the two modalities of interest for memory investigation. I developed behavioral paradigms for mice, aiming to verify whether memory retrieval within a modality leads to memory
updating and whether retrieving one modality's memory enhances memory specificity of another modality. <br>Now I have already validated the behavioral paradigm for sound memory retrieval
 and demonstrated that retrieving sound modality memory triggers memory updating within the sound modality. 
Ongoing research involves further experiments and investigations to explore the cross-modal effects of memory retrieval and its underlying circuit mechanisms.<br>

            I proficiently utilized the NRAM labeling system to mark and manipulate Npas4-dependent neuronal subpopulations, ensuring accurate targeting of specific neurons for memory updating analysis. I also actively participated in a series of experiments using the contextual fear conditioning (CFC) paradigm in mice, primarily
            focusing on learning and understanding the research process, Assisted senior researchers in key tasks, such as ensuring the proper maintenance and preparation of the fear conditioning chamber between trials. And I employed optogenetics to inhibit or activate NRAM+ ensembles in mice and subsequently analyzed freezing behavior to
            validate the necessity and sufficiency of NRAM<sup>+</sup> ensembles in memory updating processes.

            I spearheaded the "Mucosal Healing" project, conducted literature reviews to select the appropriate secretion peptides gene, cloned, linked it to TFF3 via a Ser/Gly linker and validated the expression with Western Blotting. To control the expression of TFF3 gene, I introduced the NO sensor as an molecular switch. I also collaborated in editing the introductory video of project, contributed to the iGEM wiki uploads, highlighting the innovative
approach for IBD treatment.
