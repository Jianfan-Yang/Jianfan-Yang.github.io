          When I was in high school, I won a gold medal in the National Biology Olympiad and secured direct admission to the School of Life Sciences at Tsinghua University. During my undergraduate studies, my research focus has been on Neurobiology and Synthetic Biology. 

In my first year, I was selected for the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) team, which usually picks second-year students. With <a href="https://life.tsinghua.edu.cn/lifeen/info/1034/1088.htm" target="_blank">Prof. Guoqiang Chen</a>'s guidance, I spent a year researching Synthetic Biology. From my second year, I joined <a href="https://life.tsinghua.edu.cn/lifeen/info/1035/1105.htm" target="_blank">Prof. Yi Zhong</a>'s lab, studying the mechanisms of learning and memory.

During the summer of my third year, I worked at the Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) under the mentorship of <a href="https://www.sickkids.ca/en/staff/j/sheena-josselyn/" target="_blank">Prof. Sheena Josselyn</a>, who is one of the early pioneers of the engram theory. This experience helped me dive deeper into learning and memory research and introduced me to new techniques.

<br>Outside of academics, music holds a place in my heart. I've been learning opera singing (bel canto) since my freshman year and have joined marching band, choir as well as musical club, and have won <i>Expressive Musical Genius & Gold Prize (Age 18-21)</i> in Global Genius Music Competition

and <i>Dazzling Virtuoso Special Award & Gold Prize (Romantic B)</i> in Royale Music Competition. I genuinely believe that science and art enrich one another, highlighting the diverse ways humans can be creative.

In short, I am someone with a profound appreciation for both the intricacies of the brain and the magic of music, striving to become a scientist with refined tastes and aspirations.

          <h3>Finding the Neural Basis of Memory Integration in Rodents</h3>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            I applied Python DABEST package for data analysis on the duration of time mice spent in different zones of an open arena, refining the analytical process and optimizing output results. And I developed a new data visualization method based on Matlab polarscatter function, which adds time information to existing
orientation angles of mice using color and radius, generating figures for potential publication. To gain a deeper understanding of the experimental paradigms, I also engaged in Morris water maze experiments on mice to explore the impacts of social isolation on spatial memory.<br>

          <h3>Dynamic Encoding and Modulation of Engrams in the Lateral Amygdala (LA)</h3>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            I investigated two dynamics of engrams in the LA: whether they are predetermined to encode positive or negative memories, and the mechanisms underlying the transition from recent to remote memory.
            <br>In the first part, I conducted molecular cloning to integrate optogenetics into MAPseq, creating a functional construct validated by behavioral assays.
            In the second part, I found that chemogenetic activation of parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons in the LA suppresses the expression of remote fear memory after 30 days, indicated by decreased activation in the auditory cortex (AuV/TeA).
            To quantify freezing behavior in mice, I utilized the "ezTrack" pipeline from the Cai lab, performing linear regression with manual scoring to identify optimal parameters and confirm the pipeline's accuracy.

          <h3>Memory Retrieval Induces Cross-modal Updating of Multi-modal Memory and Its Underlying Mechanisms</h3>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            When you hear a song, do you naturally recall the scene where you heard it before? This suggests that there may be interactions between different modalities of memory. Therefore, I want to study whether memory can undergo cross-modal updating and its underlying mechanisms. 
            To simplify the issue, I have chosen context and sound as the modalities for my research and have constructed a cross-modal memory retrieval behavioral paradigm for mice. I have already demonstrated that allowing mice to perform sound retrieval can enhance the accuracy of the contextual memory. Future plans include verifying the interaction in reverse and using TRAP2 mice to label neurons that respond specifically during the updating process for circuit tracing.<br>

            I proficiently utilized the NRAM labeling system to label and manipulate Npas4-dependent ensembles in mice, ensuring accurate targeting of specific neurons for memory updating analysis. I also actively participated in a series of experiments using the contextual fear conditioning (CFC) paradigm, primarily
            focusing on learning and understanding the research process, assisting senior researchers in key tasks, such as ensuring the proper maintenance and preparation of the fear conditioning chamber between trials. And I employed optogenetics to inhibit or activate NRAM+ ensembles in mice and subsequently analyzed freezing behavior to
            validate the necessity and sufficiency of NRAM<sup>+</sup> ensembles in memory updating processes.

            I spearheaded the "Therapeutic Protein Secretion" project, conducted literature reviews to select the appropriate therapeutic protein, Trefoil Factor 3 (TFF3), and secretion peptides genes, linked them together via a Ser/Gly linker. Then I validated TFF3 expression in <i>Nissle 1917</i> with Western Blotting, introduced different sensors as molecular switches to control the expression and evaluated the effectiveness of the sensors by GFP reporter. I also collaborated in editing the introductory video of project, contributed to the iGEM wiki uploads, highlighting the innovative
approach for IBD treatment.
